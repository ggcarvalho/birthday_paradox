# Monte Carlo simulation of the birthday paradox

This program uses a Mote Carlo approach to calculate probability that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday.

Run `python monte_carlo_bday.py` and type the the number of people and the number of simulations. Se this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem) for more information about the birthday paradox.
